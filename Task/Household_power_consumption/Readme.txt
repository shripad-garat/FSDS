Problem Name:- Individual household electric power consumption
Aim: To build the regression ML model to predect the total mettring of house hold 
Objective : 
        1.Data ingestion
        2.EDA
        3.Preprocessing
        4.Pickling for the preprocessing object(save the preprocessing model)
        5.After preprocessing store data inside MONGODB
        6.Load the data from mongo db (For model bulding purpose)
        7.Model Bulding:
                  Regression:linear regression,ridge regression,lasso regression,elastic net, support vector regression
        8.Hyperparameter tuning(GRID SEARCH CV)
        9.Evaluation of the model
                   Regression evaluation matrix: R2 and adjusted R2
